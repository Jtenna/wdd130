        <p>Hello. Welcome to my page. My name is Justina Eguare, but you can call me Tina. I leave in Nigeria and I have a cat and a dog called Lucy and Greg. Would love to know more about you and how we can connect. <br>
          I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I love the gospel. My best memories of my conversion is being baptized with my dad, 
          brother and sister and the warm reception we received in our ward. The love of Heavenly Father was felt that day and there was profound peace and assurance in my heart that
          I was in the right place. I always visit the temple because I love the ambience and the feeling of closeness to God it affords. 
          I love being there and would love to visit a few more temples outside my country. Some of my favorite temples are;</p>
